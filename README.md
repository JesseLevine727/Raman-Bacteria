# Raman-Bacteria
Collected spectra from 6 different bacterial species to build spectral data base. 
Spectral database used to train ML models, to cluster and identify the species.

Included withtin the repo. is the raw spectral readings, the code to graph them and clean them and different analysis scripts: PCA, KMeans, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Neural Network

The data files contain 400 spectra eaach.


Species: Staphylococcus aureus
         Corynebacterium striatum
         Pseudomonas aeruginosa
         E.coli
         Stenotrophomonas maltophilia
