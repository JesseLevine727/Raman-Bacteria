# Raman-Bacteria
Collected spectra from 6 different bacterial species to build spectral data base. 
Spectral database used to train ML models, to cluster and differentiate between the species.

Included withtin the repo. is the raw spectral readings, the code to graph them and clean them and different analysis scripts: PCA..more coming sooon
The data files contain 100-200 spectra eaach.


Species: Staphylococcus aureus
         Corynebacterium striatum
         Pseudomonas aeruginosa
         E.coli
